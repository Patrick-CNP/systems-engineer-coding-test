# Redbubble Systems Engineer Test

Build a simple dockerised web app that meets the requirements listed below.

## Functional requirements
- Create a dockerised web app
- Use any language you like
- Should respond to `/`, `/treasure` and `/_health`
	- `/`: Prints 'Hello World' in any design you like (we won't be judging the design). Returns 200
	- `/treasure`: Return a configurable string. You may choose whether to display the string in machine-readable or human-readable form.
	- `/_health`: Returns a structured, machine-readable API response saying whether everything is OK. Returns 200
- Log to STDOUT, preferably structured
- Should take configuration via environment variables
- Building and running the application should be easy. Provide instructions.

## Other requirements
- Include some documentation, including letting us know how you know your solution works.
- Write code which you would be proud to commit at work or to an open-source project.
- If you use version control while developing your submission, please include the version history with your submission. This allows us to see the process that you followed while you worked. For example, if you commit to git as you worked, please include the .git directory in the zip file that you send us.
- We're not timing you, and you can take as much time as you like, but this test is intended to take you no more than a few hours.
